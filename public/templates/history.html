    <h4>Public transportation in New York City began in the late 1820s with horse power.</h4>

      <p>Omnibuses were oversized stagecoaches that ran along a fixed route.  They were meant to seat fifteen passengers, although they were often cramped with more – both inside and on top!  The driver stopped when passengers tugged on a strap attached to his ankle.</p>

      <p>Horsecars, streetcars that rode along embedded iron or steel tracks, were designed to carry more people and offer a smoother ride than omnibuses.  Passengers asked the conductor, who rode at the back, to signal their stops to the driver by ringing a bell.</p>

      <p>Horse-drawn vehicles jammed city streets because their numbers weren’t regulated.  In addition, horses were slow, they had trouble climbing hilly streets, produced lots of manure, and most could only work an average of five years.</p>

      <p>In the late 1890's to early 1900's electric vehicles were replacing horses on the street of NYC. At the turn of the century, there were up to 1000 electric taxicabs in operation.</p>

      <p>In 1907, a fire destroyed many of the electric taxicabs, and the Electric Vehicle Company collapsed. Horse-drawn cabs once again became the primary means of transportation around NYC.</p>

		<h3>Carriage horses have a long history with NYC</h3>

    <p>Central Park was the first landscaped public park in the United States. Advocates of creating the park--primarily wealthy merchants and landowners--admired the public grounds of London and Paris and urged that New York needed a comparable facility to establish its international reputation. A public park, they argued, would offer their own families an attractive setting for carriage rides and provide working-class New Yorkers with a healthy alternative to the saloon.<p>

    <p>After three years of debate over the park site and cost, in 1853 the state legislature authorized the City of New York to use the power of eminent domain to acquire more than 700 acres of land in the center of Manhattan.</p>

    <p>Central Park's wide, meandering pathways were partly created to be enjoyed from a carriage, providing a chance for people living in crowded urban areas to go for a drive in the country without leaving New York.</p>

    <p>Historians say the Central Park carriage rides became popular in the second half of the 19th century, when middle class New Yorkers began to join the wealthy in the park on the weekends for a rare escape from the congestion of the city. Carriages have been for hire in Central Park since 1859, but most consider the industry as we know it today to have begun in the late 1940's.</p>

	     <p>With the advent of the automobile, only fifteen horse-drawn carriages
        operated in New York City by 1935, staying mostly within the
        confines of Central Park. However, the Gasoline rations during World War II renewed interest in carriage horse rides, many of the new carriage drivers remained after the
        war, increasing the competition for business and the industry grew larger as Americans began to vacation in large numbers.</p>
        <p>In the late 1940s and early 1950s, New York City’s Irish-born mayor sold sixty-eight carriage licenses, or medallions, to two Irish expatriate stable owners for
        $100 to $200 each. In the 1960s and 1970s, the medallion owners
        began selling their extra licenses, pushing the business farther outside
        of Central Park as more carriages competed for fares. These new carriage
        enterprises operated virtually unregulated.</p>
        <p>Today, the system is regulated by the DOH, ASPCA, and the Department of Consumer Affairs.</p>

      <p>Unlike other cities, the New York City carriage industry is run by a collective of individual owners with medallions, rather than by carriage companies that own a fleet of carriages. Medallions are often passed down through families. Even the stables, though privately-owned, are run by a co-op of medallion owners. Though not all the drivers own the stable itself, they pay dues to the co-op.</p>

        <p>There are only four carriage stables left in the city, all privately owned and located within a 15-block stretch of the same neighborhood, between W. 37th and W. 52nd Sts., off of 11th Ave.</p>

        <p>There are currently 68 carriage horse medallions, between 180-220 horses, and around 160 full time drivers.</p>
